In this project is analyzed a time series about electricity demand in 2015. It is analyzed the behaviour of the serie weekly, daily, monthly.. and so on. Morever, when a time serie is being studied is important to find patterns within data, therefore, you will see how to study the trend, seasonality and residuals of a serie. In additon, it is mandatory to find out whether exists or not exist autocorrelation between every point of the serie. 
Finally, you could check how to create a forecast model using fbprophet library to predict how the serie should behave in the future.
